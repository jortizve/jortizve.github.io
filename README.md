## About Me

I am a researcher at the **Faculty of Computer Science, University of Namur (UNamur)**, and a member of the **Research Center on Information Systems Engineering**.  
My work focuses on **formal verification**, **timed automata**, **model-based testing**, and **temporal/dynamic logics** for **real-time systems**.

I have contributed to developing advanced mutation testing techniques for timed models, new logical frameworks for reasoning about dynamic games, and efficient verification tools such as **MUPPAAL**.  
My research blends theoretical foundations with practical tool development, aiming to improve the reliability and performance of **safety-critical and time-sensitive systems**.
